            <h3>What is Pastafarianism?</h3>
            <p>Pastafarianism, also known as the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, is a satirical religion created to criticize the teaching of intelligent design and creationism in schools. It was founded in 2005 by Bobby Henderson in response to a school board decision in Kansas to allow the teaching of intelligent design as an alternative to evolution. The religion's core belief is that a Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM) created the universe, and its followers advocate for the separation of church and state, as well as the teaching of science in education. Pastafarianism uses humor and parody to highlight the absurdity of presenting unproven religious ideas as scientific facts. Despite its origins as a social commentary, some people have embraced it as a legitimate belief system, emphasizing values such as kindness, humor, and the importance of critical thinking.</p>
